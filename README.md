### Intro

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository, a curated collection of projects I undertook at 42 Seoul. This space is a reflection of my learning journey, showcasing a range of applications and solutions crafted during my time at 42.

The projects uploaded here are in the process of being refactored, meaning all the code will be rewritten. Consequently, the Norminette rules may not be strictly adhered to, and there might be slight deviations from the original subject requirements.
